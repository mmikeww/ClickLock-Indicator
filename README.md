# ClickLock-Indicator
ClickLock is an accessibility feature in Windows which allows you to click, hold for a second, and then release, but after releasing, the mouse down click is still held and locked. This allows you to click+drag without having to hold down the click the entire time, which is especially useful when using a laptop touchpad where your finger might run off the edge. The ClickLock is ended by simply clicking again.

The problem is that Windows does not display any indicator to let you know when the ClickLock has been activated. This is a simple script that will display a visual cue next to the mouse to remedy that.

This script is written in AutoHotkey, and has versions available for both AHK v1.1 and AHK v2.0
